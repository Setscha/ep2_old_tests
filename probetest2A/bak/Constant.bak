// 'Constant' implements 'Polynomial' and is used by class 'HornerScheme' to represent a polynomial
// with degree 0. Its value is a*x‚Å∞ = a (regardless of the 'x' used for evaluation).
// The iterator of this class iterates over only one value and therefore behaves as follows:
// The 'next' method returns the value of 'this' (specified by 'a'), if it is called for the first
// time. 'hasNext' is 'true' only if 'next' has not been called.
